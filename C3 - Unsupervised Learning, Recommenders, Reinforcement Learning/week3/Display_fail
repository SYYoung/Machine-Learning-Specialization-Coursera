Once in a while you might run into the following error:

_XSERVTransmkdir: ERROR: euid != 0,directory /tmp/.X11-unix will not be created.
_XSERVTransSocketUNIXCreateListener: mkdir(/tmp/.X11-unix) failed, errno = 2
_XSERVTransMakeAllCOTSServerListeners: failed to create listener for local
(EE) Fatal server error:
(EE) Cannot establish any listening sockets - Make sure an X server isn't already running(EE)
To solve it just a few commands are needed, itâ€™s just a workaround but worked every time so far:

mkdir /tmp/.X11-unix
sudo chmod 1777/tmp/.X11-unix
sudo chown root /tmp/.X11-unix/
It can also happen that Xvfb crashed but still blocking the display port. It is then not possible to restart Xvfb on the same display port:
Fatal server error:
Server is already active for display 1337
    If this server is no longer running, remove /tmp/.X1337-lock
    and start again.
As suggested from the message the lock file needs to be removed:
rm /tmp/.X1337-lock
Afterwards it is possible to start Xvfb again on display port 1337.
